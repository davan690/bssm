bssm 0.1.3 (Release date: 2018-01-05)
==============
  * Streamlined the output of the print method for MCMC results.
  * Fixed a bug in Gaussian prediction intervals.
  * Fixed some package dependencies.
  * Sampling for standard deviation parameters of BSM and their non-Gaussian counterparts 
    is now done in logarithmic scale for slightly increased efficiency.
  
bssm 0.1.2 (Release date: 2017-11-21)
==============
  * API change for run_mcmc: All MCMC methods are now under the argument method, 
    instead of having separate arguments for delayed acceptance and IS schemes.
  * summary method for MCMC output now omits the computation of SE and ESS in order 
    to speed up the function.
  * Added new model class lgg_ssm, which is a linear-Gaussian model defined 
    directly via C++ like non-linear nlg_ssm models. This allows more flexible
    prior definitions and complex system matrix constructions.
  * Added another new model class, sde_ssm, which is a model with continuous 
    state dynamics defined as SDE. These too are defined via couple 
    simple C++ functions.
  * Added non-gaussian AR(1) model class.
  * Added argument nsim for predict method, which allows multiple draws per MCMC iteration.
  * The noise multiplier matrices H and R in nlg_ssm models can now depend on states.
  
bssm 0.1.1-1 (Release date: 2017-06-27)
==============
  * Use byte compiler.
  * Skip tests relying in certain numerical precision on CRAN.
  
bssm 0.1.1 (Release date: 2017-06-27)
==============
  
  * Switched from C++11 PRNGs to sitmo.
  * Fixed some portability issues in C++ codes.

bssm 0.1.0 (Release date: 2017-06-24)
==============

  * Initial release.
