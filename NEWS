bssm 0.1.2 (Release date: -)
==============
  * API change for run_mcmc: All MCMC methods are now under the argument method, 
    instead of having separate arguments for delayed acceptance and IS schemes.
  * summary method for MCMC output now omits the computation of SE and ESS in order 
    to speed up the function.
  * Added new model class lgg_ssm, which is a linear-Gaussian model defined 
    directly via C++ like non-linear nlg_ssm models. This allows more flexible
    prior definitions and complex system matrix constructions.
  * Added another new model class, sde_ssm, which is a model with continuous 
    state dynamics defined as SDE. These too are defined via couple 
    simple C++ functions.
